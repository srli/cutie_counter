Ember is a bright, young aspiring novelist. She works at the local library during the afternoons, although she often slacks off by reading the works she is supposed to be organizing. She enjoys searching for inspiration for her own novel in the writing of those she admires. Her dream is to live in a huge library with the one she loves most. Her bright and cheery encouragement is well suited to writers who need a good friend.
